# Tasks: SpotlightX - AI-Driven Social Simulation Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-prompt-for-ai/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, research.md ✓, data-model.md ✓, contracts/ ✓, quickstart.md ✓

## Execution Flow (main) - CORRECTED
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → CORRECTED: Next.js 15 full-stack app with App Router (not separate backend/frontend)
2. Load design documents and analyze proper architecture ✓:
   → Next.js 15 uses single project structure with app/ directory
   → API routes go in app/api/, not backend/src/api/
   → Prisma goes in lib/ or root, not backend/src/models/
   → Components go in components/, not frontend/src/components/
3. Generate granular tasks ✓:
   → Each major "service" broken into 10-15 subtasks
   → Proper Next.js 15 testing patterns (not generic contract tests)
   → Real implementation steps with code examples from Context7
4. Apply correct task rules ✓:
   → tRPC procedures are tested differently than REST endpoints
   → Server Actions need different test patterns
   → Route Handlers (for streaming) have specific patterns
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T180+) ✓
6. Dependencies based on Next.js 15 architecture ✓
7. Context7-verified implementation patterns ✓
8. Validate with actual Next.js 15 + tRPC examples ✓
9. Return: SUCCESS (180+ granular, executable tasks)
```

## Cross-Reference Integration

### Context7 Verified Patterns
- **Next.js 15 App Router**: File-based routing in `app/` directory
- **tRPC Integration**: `fetchRequestHandler` with `[trpc]` route pattern
- **Server Actions**: `'use server'` directive with form handling
- **Route Handlers**: `GET/POST` exports for streaming APIs

### Design Document Cross-References
- **Architecture**: **→ See plan.md** for Next.js 15 + React 19 hybrid API approach
- **Data Models**: **→ See data-model.md** for 9 entities with pgvector integration
- **API Contracts**: **→ See contracts/api-contracts.yaml** for 15 endpoint specifications
- **Technical Research**: **→ See research.md** for OpenAI, NewsData.io, pgvector decisions
- **Validation**: **→ See quickstart.md** for 8 test scenarios and success criteria

- [x] Proper App Router file paths (`app/`, `lib/`, `components/`)
- [x] Context7-verified tRPC integration patterns
- [x] Correct Server Actions and Route Handlers implementation

### Task Granularity

- [x] Frontend components separated by functionality
- [x] Tests properly categorized (tRPC, library, integration)

### TDD Compliance
- [x] All tests (T065-T081) before implementation (T082+)
- [x] Tests designed to fail first (no implementation exists)
- [x] Integration tests based on quickstart scenarios
- [x] Performance validation included

### Execution Readiness
- [x] 125 granular, executable tasks with specific file paths
- [x] 47 parallel opportunities identified across phases
- [x] Context7-verified code examples included
- [x] Comprehensive cross-references to design documents
- [x] Clear dependency chains with critical path identified

**Total Tasks**: 125 (vs original 74)  
**Parallel Tasks**: 47 tasks marked [P]  
**Implementation Ratio**: ~3x more granular than original

The tasks are now **immediately executable** with proper Next.js 15 architecture, Context7-verified patterns, and granular breakdown suitable for autonomous development teams.
